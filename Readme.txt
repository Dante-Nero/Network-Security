Welcomme to the Network Security code repo. 

This repo consists of python programs which I created to understand what is happening behind the scene of the security encryption algortihms and some exploits. 

Primegen.py --- Generates a prime number for the RSA algorithm to work on. It also does a Primecheck for the program. 

RSA.py --- RSA executes RSA program with keygen, encrypt and decrypt function with the help of the primegen.py program. 

md5.py --- This programs does the md5 rotation for encrypting the plain text and hash and vice versa. 

ftp_basic.py -- This is a basic program to brute force ftp attack on the server which has the ftp port open.
